## Professional Overview

As a Sales Engineer at **AST**, I manage the technical-commercial lifecycle for capital aseptic equipment, ranging from standalone tabletop units to fully integrated robotic fill-finish automation. My role is defined by the "Technical Bridge" concept—translating rigid customer **User Requirement Specifications (URS)** into viable engineering scopes while ensuring strict adherence to **cGMP compliance**.



## Strategic Impact

In my first six months, I have directly supported **$11.5M in Total Contract Value (TCV)** across 7 major capital projects. This success is built on four core pillars:

* **Technical Consultation**: Serving as the primary technical resource during on-site visits and pre-sales reviews to address specific inquiries regarding machine capabilities and regulatory compliance.
* **Sales Handover Leadership**: Synthesizing complex signed proposal data into comprehensive **PowerPoint presentations** for internal handover meetings. This ensures that the technical vision sold to the customer is accurately communicated to the engineering and operations teams.
* **Scope Change Management**: Executing technical and commercial evaluations for **Scope Change Requests (SCRs)**. I meticulously re-map new customer requests against the original **URS** to verify compliance and provide updated pricing and timelines, ensuring project profitability remains intact.
* **Requirement Mapping**: Developing compliance matrices that map customer URS to system capabilities, identifying and resolving potential gaps before contract finalization.

## Technical Workflow & Tools

### 1. Spatial Validation (CAD)
Using **Autodesk Inventor**, I develop early-stage 3D system layouts to visualize cleanroom integration. This allows customers to see exactly how equipment fits within their specific facility footprint, reducing project risk and accelerating the sales cycle.

### 2. Proposal Engineering
I utilize **Proposify** and **Salesforce** to generate highly detailed technical proposals. These documents include granular timelines, detailed quotes, and specific technical specifications derived from **AST's** proprietary quoting systems.

### 3. Industry Literacy
My work is grounded in deep industry knowledge, including the study of **"Practical Aseptic Processing Fill and Finish"** to better understand the nuances of sterile manufacturing environments.
