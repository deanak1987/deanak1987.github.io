## Overview

As part of my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering capstone at Washington State University, I led the mechanical design and FEA analysis for a novel clearing plate system that extended the operational life of Forest Concepts' sub-millimeter rotary shear from 10-20 hours to significantly longer run times.

**Sponsor:** Forest Concepts  
**Team Members:** Dean Kelley, Ian Aupperle, Forrest Fanara, Loren Bonner  
**Duration:** Spring 2017  
**My Contribution:** 128.5 hours

## The Challenge

Forest Concepts partnered with Washington State University to develop efficient biofuel production from reclaimed biomass. Their rotary shear system could shred wood chips into sub-millimeter particles—critical for maximizing surface area in the chemical conversion process. However, the system had a fundamental flaw: small particles rapidly clogged the cutting device, causing frequent failures after just 10-20 hours of operation.

The existing clearing plates that removed material were ineffective, and the system faced three key problems:

1. **Rapid wear and failure** - plates lasted only 10-20 hours
2. **Difficult replacement** - time-consuming maintenance procedures
3. **Single-direction operation** - inability to run cutters in reverse

## Technical Approach

### Material Selection & Analysis

My primary focus was developing the mechanical design and validating it through finite element analysis. The original clearing plates suffered from friction-induced wear where they contacted the blade bushings. I explored several solutions:

- **Metal coating investigation** - Researched electroplating options including Nye-Tef ($816 for 192 plates) and hard chrome ($1,142.40). Deemed too expensive.
- **Alternative materials** - Ran SolidWorks simulations comparing multiple steel alloys
- **Final selection** - Fully Hardened 1095 Spring Steel, selected for superior hardness and abrasion resistance based on Brinell hardness comparisons

### Design Innovation

I produced several clearing plate designs and mounting configurations, ultimately contributing the final plate geometry that the team presented to Forest Concepts. Key design features included:

- **Reversible double-sided plates** - enabling bidirectional operation
- **Improved mounting system** - hitch-pin design (developed by teammate Forrest Fanara using my mounting location concept)
- **3D-printed C-clip spacers** - reducing friction between plates and blades
- **Enhanced durability** - optimized geometry to handle stress loads

### Simulation & Validation

After studying Forest Concepts' initial simulation setup, I developed an improved FEA methodology:

- Created non-penetrating fixture systems for more accurate stress analysis
- Ran parametric studies with different materials to identify optimal performance
- Validated clearing plate designs under operational loading conditions
- Documented factor of safety, stress distributions, and deflection patterns

All designs were tested and validated using SolidWorks Simulation before prototype manufacturing.

## Manufacturing & Prototyping

The team collaborated with DS&T to waterjet cut the first prototype clearing plate. I contributed to:

- Converting 3D CAD models to DXF format for waterjet cutting
- Part drawing creation and manufacturing specifications
- Material sourcing (team purchased 1095 steel sheets)
- Physical model assembly for presentation

## Safety & Standards Compliance

The design incorporated OSHA safety standards:

- **29 CFR 1910.144** - Color-coding recommendations for operator safety around exposed cutters
- **OSHA 1910.145** - Warning signage requirements for rotating machinery
- Contrast color selection between clearing plates and cutters to prevent operator injury

## Challenges Overcome

**Software compatibility issues** - WSU's SolidWorks (2016 SP2) was incompatible with Forest Concepts' version (2016 SP5). I developed workarounds including remote desktop streaming and STL file conversions to maintain project momentum.

**Design center Wi-Fi** - Persistent connectivity issues in the senior design lab required flexible working arrangements and offline collaboration strategies.

**Documentation** - Learned the importance of concurrent documentation rather than retroactive reporting—a lesson I've carried throughout my career.

## Results & Deliverables

- **Extended operational life** - clearing plates designed to significantly outlast the 10-20 hour baseline
- **Functional prototype** - waterjet-cut prototype validated design feasibility
- **Complete technical package** - CAD models, FEA results, manufacturing drawings, and safety documentation
- **Professional presentation** - delivered technical findings to sponsor and academic reviewers

## Key Takeaways

This capstone project taught me essential engineering and professional skills:

- **Cross-functional collaboration** - coordinating with team members, sponsors, and external manufacturers
- **Design for manufacturability** - balancing performance requirements with production constraints
- **FEA methodology** - developing accurate simulation techniques for real-world validation
- **Professional communication** - presenting complex technical solutions to diverse stakeholders

The experience of moving from concept through analysis to physical prototype manufacturing solidified my understanding of the complete product development cycle—skills I continue to apply in my current role as a Sales Engineer supporting capital equipment projects.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- SolidWorks CAD & Simulation (FEA)
- Material selection and mechanical properties analysis
