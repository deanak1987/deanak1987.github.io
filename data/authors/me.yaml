bio: |
  Sales Engineer with a Master's degree and a deep technical background in Machine Learning and Data Science. 
  I bridge the gap between complex technical solutions and business value, with a particular focus on 
  distributed computing, GxP regulated life sciences, and IoT home automation. 
  When I'm not optimizing WSI toolkits, I'm documenting my 1987 Toyota Corolla FX16 GTS build for autocross.
