bio: |
  Sales Engineer with a Master's degree and a deep technical background in Machine Learning and Data Science. 
  I bridge the gap between complex technical solutions and business value, with a particular focus on 
  data science, GxP regulated life sciences, and mechanical design. 
  When I'm not supporting sales, I'm spending time with my lovely wife and our two boys. I am also in the middle of documenting my 1987 Toyota Corolla FX16 GTS build for autocross.
